## Welcome! üëã

### Introduction ü§ù
I am a Software Engineer specializing in JavaScript (particularly TypeScript and React, and previous experience with Vue and Node.js) with full-stack LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) experience.

Since 2020, I have designed, developed, and refined features for Cloud Manager, Linode/Akamai's user interface built with React and TypeScript that serves over 1 million users globally and enables the deployment and management of virtual machines (VMs) and other cloud infrastructure.
